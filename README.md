*This program converts your keyboard numeric pad into a telephone-style keypad.*

## Layout
The application is layout agnostic. You can use it either you're with QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak or any other.

Here is the actual in-app layout:

## How to convert your numpad into a telephone keypad?

While this application is running, your keystrokes are caught and converted. The numeric pad of your keyboard will act as faithfully as possible like a real _feature (?dumb) phone_ keypad [multi-tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-tap) system.

* Tapping on one key will cycle you through the possible values. You validate either by using another key or by pressing NEXT/SPACE/ENTER (see the visual).

* Switch CAPS LOCK by pressing the CAPS button (no visual feedback for now).

## Feedback and improvement

Got ideas to improve the project? Open an issue on this repository and we'll talk about it.

Wanna contribute? You're very welcome. Here you'll find some ToDo and ideas.

ToDo:
- [ ] Add special characters and numbers;
- [ ] Add an activation/deactivation key;
- [ ] Visual feedback for `CAPS LOCK` and `NUM LOCK`;
- [ ] (?) Show characters while cycling through possible states.

### C# or VB.net port

I would like to port this software to C# or VB.net in order to make it lighter, give it an installer, a system-tray icon, etc. Contributions are very welcome.
